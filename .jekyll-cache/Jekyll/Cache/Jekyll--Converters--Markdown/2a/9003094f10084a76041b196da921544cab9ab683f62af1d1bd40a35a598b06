I"’<p>Hey, Iâ€™am <a href="https://github.com/williamcanin/typing-jekyll-template" target="_blank">Typing</a>. Iâ€™m a theme <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> Inspired by the habit of typing. Using an appearance that resembles the typewriter. A simple, fast and efficient way of reading, just like the old days.</p>

<p>â€˜Typingâ€™ is intended for users with more technical content than for users who wish to have a stylish page. Keep it simple!</p>

<p><strong>Letâ€™s get some details:</strong></p>

<p>This page exists to put everything about you, as if it were a simplified â€˜Aboutâ€™. The file for editing this page is in the directory root: <code class="highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>.</p>

<p>You already have a template page for â€˜Blogâ€™, â€˜Projectsâ€™, â€˜Searchâ€™, â€˜Contactâ€™, â€˜Tagsâ€™ and â€˜Resumeâ€™, but you can change as you want, modifying property values.</p>
